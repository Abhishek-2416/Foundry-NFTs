## Working of IPFS

1. It first hashes our data and gives us a unique output
2. We can then pin that file or data to our node
3. Our node is connected to massive IPFS node and they talk to each to give us the specific hash
4. And other nodes can also pin your data , so anyone on the decentralised network can pin and keep your hash of the data with themselves
